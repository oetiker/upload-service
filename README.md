upload-service
==============

A File-Upload Web Application capable of dealing with *LARGE* files. The
backend is written in Perl using http://mojolicious.org, the frontend
leverages http://github.com/23/resumable.js

installation
------------
Use the classic ./configure; make install approach.

Once installed you will find a htdoc directory in your installation
target.

Copy this directory into your webserver and configure the webserver to
execute fcgi (fastcgi) scripts. Note that in the htdocs directory
there is also a .htaccess file.

Since the file-upload service is based on Mojolicious, you can use any of
the modes of operation supported by Mojolicious.

configuration
-------------

The upload service gets is configured via several environement variables.

Set US_ROOT to define where the uploaded files should end up

 US_ROOT=/path

The system has two modes of operatation. Single user mode and multi user mode

 US_SINGLEUSER=0|1

in single user mode the uploads go straight to $US_ROOT in multi user mode the
uploads go to $US_ROOT/$USERNAME/INBOX

in multi user mode the url for upload is expected to contain the $USERNAME
and the script must run as root (use sudo) so that it can suid to the
recipient of the files.

In single user mode you get

 http://your-site/script-url/

In multi-user mode you get

 http://your-site/script-url/USERNAME/

In multi user mode, the MOJO_TMPDIR must point to an empty directory
with mode 0777.

If you want to hand out 'individual' upload urls, you can enable tag mode

 US_TAGMODE=1

In tag mode, the upload url will look like this:

 http://your-site/script-url/TAG

the tag must be made up from [0-9a-z]+

Once the upload is complete the name of the uploaded file(s) will start with the given tag.

Enjoy!
